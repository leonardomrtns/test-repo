[APPLAUSE]

00:00:10.986 --> 00:00:12.360
MICHAEL POLLAN:
Thank you, David.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.070
Thanks very much.

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.440
Can everybody hear
me in the back?

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.470
So I get to talk about
my trips, but you don't?

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.924
It doesn't seem fair.

00:00:20.924 --> 00:00:22.590
So I'm just talking
for about 10 minutes

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.089
and just tell you a little bit
about what this book's about,

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:27.230
and then I'd love to
take your questions

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.530
and let your interest
dictate the path

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.659
that we take this afternoon.

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:33.260
First, thanks.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.690
Thank you very much for coming.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.595
This book is a real
departure for me.

00:00:38.595 --> 00:00:40.970
Those of you who know me as
someone who writes about food

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.830
might think it's a
little weird that I'm

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.290
turning to psychedelics,
but in my head

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.050
there is some continuity,
as well as change.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.730
And the continuity is that
I see my writing about food

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.760
as part of a larger interest
in writing about nature,

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.062
and the way we eat affects
nature dramatically-- more

00:01:00.062 --> 00:01:01.520
than anything else
we do, actually,

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.879
in terms of changing the
landscape of the planet

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.560
and the atmosphere.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.440
And I mean, it's your
most powerful engagement

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.870
with the natural world, and
I've always been interested

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:12.890
in that engagement.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.130
And we use nature and plants,
especially, for many things.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.420
Food is an obvious one.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.050
Beauty is another, but
something we almost all

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.730
use plants for that I've always
been kind of curious about

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:30.440
is to change consciousness.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.660
Most of us today
probably used a plant

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.970
to change the
contents of your mind,

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.540
or at least the feeling
tone in your mind,

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.040
whether it was coffee, or tea,
or a cigarette, or cannabis,

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.790
or whatever it is.

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.248
I mean, this is something we
do, and every culture on earth

00:01:46.248 --> 00:01:50.290
does it with the one exception
that proves the rule.

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.680
The Inuit do not
have any plant drugs,

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.180
but it's only because none
of them grow where they live.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.970
As soon as they
go somewhere else,

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.970
they get with the program.

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.040
So it's been a long
standing interest,

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.370
and to me, it's all
part of that story

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.350
about this
fascinating engagement

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.620
we have with other species
that defines us and reveals

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:12.230
a lot about us.

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.410
And I wrote a little bit about
cannabis and botany of desire,

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.540
and I wrote a long piece about
growing opium in my garden

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.632
back in the '90s.

00:02:21.632 --> 00:02:23.340
And I've written about
medical marijuana,

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.250
so I had this interest.

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.810
And then along comes
this new research,

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.230
which I began reading about.

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.510
In 2010, I read about a
really interesting odd study

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.160
where researchers at
NYU and Johns Hopkins

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.520
were giving psilocybin--
this is the ingredient

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.610
in magic mushrooms.

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.510
They were synthesizing it--

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.570
to people who had cancer
diagnoses, people very sick,

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.190
many of them terminal, in the
hopes that they would have what

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.150
they call the
mystical experience,

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.660
a powerful spiritual
experience that

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.360
would change their
attitude toward their death

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.880
and help them essentially
to die with more peace.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.810
These were all patients
who were struggling

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.590
with depression, anxiety,
and fear-- profound fear.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.980
And the stories-- so I started
writing about that, because it

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.080
seemed like the last
thing I would want to do

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.710
is trip when I was facing a
terminal diagnosis-- to lose

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.400
control like that, and
you would presumably

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.897
have a very dark experience.

00:03:25.897 --> 00:03:27.980
So I started interviewing
these people for a piece

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.380
I did in "The New
Yorker" in 2015,

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.020
and just to give you one example
to give you the flavor of it,

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.420
I remember talking
to this woman.

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.500
She was a figure
skating instructor

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.320
in New York in Manhattan.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.560
She was about 60.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.610
She was not a psychonaut.

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.770
She had never used
psychedelics before,

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.260
and she had ovarian cancer.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.990
And her cancer had been
treated successfully,

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:54.140
but she was paralyzed by
the fear of recurrence.

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.600
She just couldn't function
because she thought any day

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.610
now this could be back.

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.880
So she entered into
this trial at NYU

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.624
and had a high dose
psilocybin experience.

00:04:06.624 --> 00:04:09.290
And I should explain how this is
done, because the image you may

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.622
have in your head of
taking psychedelics, taking

00:04:12.622 --> 00:04:15.080
a handful of mushrooms and
going to a concert or something,

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.399
this is not how it is used
in a clinical setting.

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:19.519
It's a very
controlled experience.

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.440
It's guided.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.250
So you work with two
guides, a man and a woman.

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.670
They prepare you over a
course of several sessions

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:31.350
as to what to expect.

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.760
So they'll talk to you what to
do if the experience becomes

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.240
frightening, which it often
does, and how to navigate that.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.800
They call it the
flight instructions,

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.690
and their main advice is, if
you see a staircase, go up it.

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:44.980
If you see a door, open it.

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.290
If you see a monster,
don't run away.

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.190
Just step right
up to it and say,

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:51.450
what are you doing in my head?

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.570
What do you have to teach me?

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.110
In other words, surrender
to the experience.

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:58.880
Trust.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.260
They quote John Lennon.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.740
Relax the mind and
float downstream.

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.419
And that's very
important advice,

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:07.460
and it's often the difference
between a good trip

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:08.630
and a bad trip.

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:11.002
A bad trip is essentially
a panic reaction

00:05:11.002 --> 00:05:13.460
against what's happening in
your head, which is very heavy.

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.800
I mean, you're experiencing
your ego dissolving,

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.184
in fact, in front of you.

00:05:20.184 --> 00:05:22.350
And then they sit with you
for the whole experience,

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.180
and they give you a
helping hand if you're

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.510
getting upset or struggling, and
they take you to the bathroom

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:29.280
and give you a glass of water.

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.650
And then afterwards
is a really key moment

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.940
called the integration session,
where they sit with you.

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.550
You tell the story of
your trip, and it usually

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:39.360
is this narrative.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.280
It's almost like this
intra-psychic movie

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.930
where you go different places.

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.900
And you try to make sense
of it and apply the lessons

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.080
to your life.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:53.340
So in the case of this woman--
her name is Dina Bazer--

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.640
she had this trip, and there are
many elements I won't go into.

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.630
It was like six hours.

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:01.350
And she went into her
body imaginatively,

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:05.460
and she saw this black
mass under her rib cage,

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:06.510
and that was her fear.

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:09.280
It wasn't her cancer, because
that wasn't in the right place,

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.120
but she saw what she
realized was her fear.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.830
And she screamed at her fear.

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:15.190
And you have to see this woman.

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:17.430
She's a very timid, small
woman, and she said,

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:20.250
get the fuck out of my body.

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:20.850
And it did.

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:22.590
It disappeared.

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:25.020
The black mass was gone.

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:29.400
And afterwards, she said, I
realized during that experience

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:34.200
that I can't control my cancer,
but I can control my fear,

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:37.030
and that distinction
meant everything to her.

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:40.110
And one of the hallmarks of
the psychedelic experience

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:43.560
is that whatever insights
you have during it have

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.440
a force the likes of which
you've never experienced.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.450
These are not just
opinions or insights.

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:50.049
They're revealed truths.

00:06:50.049 --> 00:06:51.840
This is something
William James a long time

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.270
ago writing about the
mystical experience

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:56.090
called the noetic sense.

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:57.720
It's a very uncanny
thing, and it's

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:03.004
what allows people to
change that, if they think--

00:07:03.004 --> 00:07:04.420
say they're trying
to quit smoking

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:08.170
and they have some epiphany
that, gee, my breath is really

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:08.710
precious.

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:10.750
I should not ruin it by smoking.

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:13.600
Suddenly that will be so
strongly held as a belief

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.350
that they can
actually stop smoking.

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:17.980
So anyway, so that's
the kind of experience

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:20.770
that I was learning about,
and I became fascinated

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:23.056
to understand the
neuroscience behind it, what's

00:07:23.056 --> 00:07:24.430
going on in the
brain when people

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:27.075
are taking one of these trips.

00:07:27.075 --> 00:07:29.200
And we now know some
interesting things about that.

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.991
If you're interested,
I can talk about that

00:07:30.991 --> 00:07:33.070
and also the history of it.

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:35.680
What happened to psychedelics
in the '60s that they

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:41.470
became so stigmatized
that research stopped?

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:43.750
There had been a very
productive period of research

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:47.140
all through the '50s
that was yielding really

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:50.310
promising results in the
treatment of alcoholism,

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:52.510
in dealing with
people who were dying,

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:55.000
depression, anxiety, obsession.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.130
And then after this
moral panic that

00:07:57.130 --> 00:08:03.340
hits the culture around 1965,
nobody studies it anymore.

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:04.540
The funding dries up.

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:06.830
Scientists are a little
embarrassed by it,

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:10.090
and we had an
unprecedented situation

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:14.380
where a promising line of
scientific investigation

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:16.000
was stopped.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.630
That never happens, and we
last 30, 35 years of research

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:21.610
into psychedelics.

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:23.212
Thankfully, it's
resuming, and my book

00:08:23.212 --> 00:08:24.670
is very much about
the renaissance,

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:26.690
even though I go back,
and look at the history,

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:31.240
and figure out why we had this
panic reaction about them,

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.250
and try to look at them
in a very matter of fact

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:35.080
way as interesting tools--

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.659
interesting tools for
understanding the mind

00:08:37.659 --> 00:08:39.280
and for healing the mind.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.140
Now, we haven't proven all this.

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:43.770
There's still more
research to be done.

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:46.077
We're kind of in
phase two, and there

00:08:46.077 --> 00:08:49.090
are three phases to
FDA drug approval,

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:52.900
but so far the results have
been remarkably encouraging.

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:56.290
It is one of the most powerful
psychiatric interventions

00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:58.480
that the researchers
have ever seen,

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:02.290
and we're in a situation
where mental health care is

00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:05.650
so broken in this country
it's failing to reach

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:08.290
half the people who need it.

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:12.580
The last major innovation
were the SSRI antidepressants

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:13.630
in the late '80s.

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:16.700
There really hasn't been
anything since then.

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:19.420
And so we need some
new ways of thinking,

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:23.640
and along comes this powerful
old but new innovation.

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:27.640
And the research is--

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:30.070
it's being privately
funded for the most part.

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:31.630
Big pharma is not
interested in this.

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:35.650
There's no intellectual
property that you can control,

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:39.940
but a lot of donors, many in
the tech community, actually,

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:43.540
have stepped up and are
funding this research.

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:46.780
And I was just at a fundraiser
where the last $7 million

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:50.390
was raised, and so
we will find out.

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:53.190
We'll get the real test,
the scientific test of what

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:55.070
are these drugs good for.

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:56.500
And then there's
the question of,

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:59.590
what value might they
have for the rest of us?

00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:03.560
Because they help people
who have serious problems,

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:05.350
but as one researcher
put it to me,

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:09.314
they're very important for
the betterment of well people.

00:10:09.314 --> 00:10:11.230
And I could talk a little
bit about that, too.

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:14.050
So as part of this, because
it's sort of my brand

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:16.120
to do immersion journalism--

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:21.346
when I wrote about the cattle
industry, I bought a steer.

00:10:21.346 --> 00:10:24.355
When I wanted to learn about
architecture, I built a house.

00:10:24.355 --> 00:10:27.370
So of course I
had to experiment,

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:31.390
and I found some
guides underground--

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:34.120
and there is a thriving
community of underground guides

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:36.790
in America-- who could give
me an experience very much

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:39.670
like the ones at
NYU and Hopkins.

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:44.650
And they were transformative
experiences, some of them,

00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:47.440
some of the most meaningful
experiences in my life.

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:49.900
And the idea that a
molecule could occasion that

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:52.900
is, to me, still
kind of mind blowing.

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:55.690
So, though I've given you
lots of leads and things

00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:57.790
you might want to
follow up on, and I'm

00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:01.210
happy to talk about
anything, I advise you not

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:03.580
to talk about your
own experiences.

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:06.130
I want to welcome the
Google micro dosing

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:07.978
club to today's event.

00:11:07.978 --> 00:11:11.722
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:14.620
Anyway, so yeah, question?

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:20.900
AUDIENCE: So I don't want
to be the devil's advocate

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:21.400
here, but--

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:22.483
MICHAEL POLLAN: Please do.

00:11:22.483 --> 00:11:25.534
AUDIENCE: --this idea that
we're going to give somebody

00:11:25.534 --> 00:11:28.200
this drug, they're going to have
this transformative experience,

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:31.820
and then it's going to
change them, I understand.

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:33.860
That makes sense
to me, but the idea

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:37.510
that that change would
necessarily be for the better--

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:40.324
that person coming back from
a trip and decides they're

00:11:40.324 --> 00:11:41.240
going to quit smoking.

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:44.030
That's great, but why doesn't
a person come back from a trip

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:46.190
and decide they need
to kill their neighbor?

00:11:48.562 --> 00:11:50.020
How do be break
the symmetry there?

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:52.430
MICHAEL POLLAN: Set and setting.

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:56.420
So one of the important
features of psychedelics

00:11:56.420 --> 00:12:01.100
is how little the experience
is foreordained or dictated

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:02.180
by the drug itself.

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:05.690
The drug is like an
unspecific mental amplifier,

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:08.570
and so your expectation
and intention

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:10.412
is very important
to what happens.

00:12:10.412 --> 00:12:12.620
And one of the things that
happens in the preparation

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:15.845
is that the guide is helping
you set an intention, like I

00:12:15.845 --> 00:12:17.220
want to quit smoking.

00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:19.780
I want to confront my mortality.

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:25.100
And you will usually have
an experience in that realm

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:28.280
because that's what you've
been primed to have.

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:32.390
Could the drugs
be used for evil?

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:34.910
Well, we have the case
of Charles Manson.

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:38.060
Manson apparently-- we
don't know all the details,

00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:44.930
but used LSD on his little posse
of what would become murderers,

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:48.490
and the drugs are
incredibly suggestible.

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:50.900
And that you could imagine
a charismatic figure

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:52.040
using them that way.

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:54.200
Now, the CIA sought to
use them that way, too.

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:57.502
The CIA had a very active
research program in the '50s.

00:12:57.502 --> 00:12:59.210
The same time all of
this university work

00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:01.280
was going on in the
'50s to help people,

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:07.040
the CIA was trying to
weaponize LSD and psilocybin.

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:09.140
They went through a series
of different paradigms.

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:12.710
One was you would use
it as a truth serum.

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:15.860
People could tell you
the truth if you gave it

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:17.990
to them in interrogation.

00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:19.580
People say crazy shit.

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:21.920
It didn't work.

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:23.060
There was no truth in that.

00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:24.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:27.590
And then they thought,
well, we could

00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:29.720
use it to have foreign leaders.

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:32.240
We could dose them, and they
would do embarrassing things.

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:33.030
That might work.

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:33.910
I don't know.

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:35.701
And we don't know how
far they got with it.

00:13:35.701 --> 00:13:37.700
And then the other
one was my control,

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:41.660
that you could use this drug
to control people's minds.

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:43.640
As far as we know, that
didn't work either,

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:46.500
but we don't know for sure.

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:48.620
And we shouldn't put
too much by them.

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:52.160
So I think it all
depends on your therapist

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:55.070
and how the situation is.

00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:58.370
People don't generally
go have violent episodes

00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:00.320
after psychedelics.

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:04.190
In general, the
experience tends to be one

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:07.010
where you discover that love
is the most important thing

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:10.310
in the universe, and this
Hallmark card platitude

00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:13.680
suddenly becomes
this profundity.

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:17.390
And it is a profundity, but
we've heard it so many times

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:18.335
that it's banal.

00:14:18.335 --> 00:14:20.210
There's an interesting
line between the banal

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:23.060
and the profound, and
psychedelics definitely

00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:24.560
works on that line.

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:29.070
So I think we should be
mindful of that possibility,

00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:30.426
but I don't think--

00:14:30.426 --> 00:14:32.300
we certainly haven't
seen anything like that.

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:35.570
There have been 1,000
dosings of volunteers

00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:38.360
since this new wave of
research, and there has not

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:40.610
been a single adverse event.

00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:45.080
No psychotic breaks, no
jumping out of windows,

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:47.780
but there is no question that
people can do stupid things

00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:49.910
on psychedelics, as
they can on alcohol

00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:51.294
and any number of other drugs.

00:14:51.294 --> 00:14:52.460
So thanks for your question.

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:52.690
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:53.378
Thank you.

00:14:56.724 --> 00:14:58.140
AUDIENCE: Do you
have any theories

00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:02.190
of why our brains are
wired to react to things

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:03.600
from plants and fungi?

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.730
And are there any things
from the animal kingdom

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:08.170
that do the same thing?

00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:11.320
MICHAEL POLLAN: Well, animals
do like plant drugs, also.

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:12.930
We have many cases of--

00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:15.910
I mean, if you've had a
cat, never give them catnip.

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:18.450
AUDIENCE: No, I mean like
any venoms that [INAUDIBLE]..

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:19.449
MICHAEL POLLAN: Oh, yes.

00:15:19.449 --> 00:15:21.630
Well, one of those
psychedelics I

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:25.020
experimented with is
something called 5-MeO-DMT.

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:26.880
This is a pretty
obscure psychedelic.

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:28.380
I see a couple of
nods in the crowd.

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:31.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:37.260
Actually only one-- that is
the smoked venom of the Sonoran

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.270
desert toad.

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:40.780
Somebody figured
that out, right?

00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:43.432
I mean, what a species, huh?

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.950
But why are we wired for this is
a really interesting question.

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:55.560
So the way the drugs
appear to work in the mind

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:59.250
is that they bind to
your serotonin-- one

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:00.960
particular serotonin
receptor that's

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:03.630
very common in the
cortex, and they

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:05.100
start a cascade of effects.

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:06.840
That's what neuroscientists
say when they really don't know

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:08.048
what's happening for a while.

00:16:08.048 --> 00:16:10.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:14.550
But that that in turn eventually
down regulates something

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:17.216
called the default mode network.

00:16:17.216 --> 00:16:18.840
I'll tell you what
that is because it's

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:22.140
very important, actually,
and it explains a lot.

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:26.010
So when they first started doing
fMRI imaging of people's brains

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:27.930
on psychedelics,
they would basically

00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:31.410
inject you with psilocybin and
slide you into the MRI machine,

00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:33.810
and you'd have what could
be a very scary experience.

00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:34.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:37.110
And then they took
these pictures,

00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:39.840
and they expected to see
lots of extra activity

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:42.930
because they're such
fireworks in the experience,

00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:44.670
but they were very
surprised to find

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:48.660
that, in fact, this
particular network went quiet.

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:50.520
And this is a network
that's very active

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:52.650
when you're not on task.

00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:55.740
It's in a seesaw relationship
with the attentional networks

00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:58.180
when you're working or
something like that,

00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:01.050
but when you're asked to just
lie back in an MRI machine,

00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:03.780
and they're trying to get
a baseline, this lights up.

00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:05.200
And they were like, why is that?

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:06.400
What is it doing?

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:08.970
Well, this appears to be
the part of your brain

00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:11.940
that is active when
you're mind wandering,

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:15.359
when you're ruminating, or
worrying, or reflecting on

00:17:15.359 --> 00:17:16.170
yourself.

00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:18.300
It's a center of
self-reflection.

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:20.730
It's also involved in
time travel, the ability

00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:24.000
to think about the
future or the past.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.950
And it's involved
in theory of mind.

00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:29.370
This is the term for
the ability to think

00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:31.950
about the mental states
of other people--

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:34.050
central to compassion, and
imagination, and things

00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:35.050
like that.

00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:39.600
And lastly, it's involved in
something called the narrative

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:41.670
self or experiential
self, and this

00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:43.510
is kind of where
you knit together

00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:48.480
what happens to you at any given
moment with the story of who

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:52.830
you are based on who you've
been and who you want to be.

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:55.140
And it's kind of
where we sustain

00:17:55.140 --> 00:18:00.030
that story that our
sense of self depends on.

00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:03.010
And so this network--

00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:04.950
so if the ego has
an address, it's

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:06.960
in the default mode network.

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:09.780
This is what the research shows.

00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:11.370
It's really
interesting that this

00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:15.030
is what gets down regulated
during the experience,

00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:17.070
and it chimes with
the experience

00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:20.760
of ego dissolution people report
on a high dose experience.

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:23.430
I had an experience
on a guided psilocybin

00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:26.040
trip where I felt
my sense of self

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:29.460
scattered to the wind like
a blizzard of post-its.

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:31.590
And then I looked
out, and I don't know.

00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:33.180
Who's the I who's
looking out at this?

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:35.070
I mean, there was a
split in consciousness

00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:39.300
where I could watch
myself then get spread

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:42.450
over the landscape like a
coat of paint out there,

00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:43.530
and I was fine with it.

00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:45.480
This other self
was fine with it.

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:49.140
And it was this kind of very
imperturbable consciousness

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:52.290
that could behold this
thing, and I realized

00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:55.340
I'm not identical to my ego.

00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:58.620
And that's a very important
insight to acquire, I think,

00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:00.240
and very useful.

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:02.400
But what was going
on in my brain

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:04.680
was the default mode
network was going offline

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:06.310
for a period of time.

00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:09.840
The sense of self dissolves,
and then something else happens,

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:12.810
which is other networks in the
brain which normally would only

00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:15.510
communicate through
this hub start

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:16.900
talking directly to each other.

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:20.150
And there's a map in the book
of the brain on a placebo

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:21.630
and the brain on psilocybin.

00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:24.264
And one looks like the route
map of American Airlines,

00:19:24.264 --> 00:19:25.680
and the other looks
like the route

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:29.820
map of some little commuter line
that only goes to 10 places.

00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:34.560
And so new connections form, and
what are those new connections?

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:37.260
I mean, that's the
interesting question.

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:41.680
Is that, say, your hippocampus
talking to your visual cortex,

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:43.530
and so you start
having images of things

00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:47.190
that you fear or desire?

00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:49.350
Is it the basis
of hallucination,

00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:52.560
or is it perhaps the basis of a
new metaphor, or a new insight,

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:53.970
or new meme?

00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:54.730
We don't know yet.

00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:57.310
That's the next step-- is
to really understand that.

00:19:57.310 --> 00:19:59.970
So these are temporary
changes in the brain.

00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:03.540
Eventually your ego
kind of reconsolidates,

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:08.960
but having had a glimpse of that
other way to behold experience

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:12.110
is very powerful, and in
my integration session

00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:13.900
I said to Mary,
who was my guide--

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:16.730
I said, well, OK, I've had
this amazing experience

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:18.080
of ego dissolution.

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:20.540
And I realized I'm not
identical to my ego.

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:23.210
I can have a little
distance on it,

00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:26.750
but I said my ego is back
in uniform and on patrol.

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:27.870
So what good is that?

00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:29.370
And she said, well,
basically you've

00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:32.900
had a taste of another
way to react to life.

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:35.210
A little less defensive, a
little less trigger happy.

00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:36.710
And you can cultivate that.

00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:37.470
And I said, how?

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:39.105
And she said,
through meditation.

00:20:39.105 --> 00:20:41.630
And meditation is kind
of how you keep alive

00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:42.980
the psychedelic experience.

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:44.642
It makes you a very
good meditator,

00:20:44.642 --> 00:20:46.100
although I know
you're not supposed

00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:51.230
to say good or bad
meditator, but being

00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:53.600
trapped in that language.

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:56.990
So that's kind of a real
shorthand of what we understand

00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:58.180
about the neuroscience.

00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:02.120
The neuroscientific
investigation of this phenomena

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:03.740
is absolutely
fascinating, and for me,

00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:07.359
that chapter of the book was
the most challenging to write.

00:21:07.359 --> 00:21:08.900
Well, not the most
challenge, but one

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:11.494
of the most challenging, and
fascinating to learn about.

00:21:11.494 --> 00:21:12.660
So thanks for your question.

00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:14.016
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:21:14.016 --> 00:21:15.830
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:17.010
MICHAEL POLLAN: Hi.

00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:20.080
AUDIENCE: So I have
heard rumors that monks

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:22.930
have been able to
achieve a similar thing

00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:26.300
to a psychedelic trip.

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:29.700
Do you know anything
about what that entails

00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:34.957
or if there's any research that
hints to it being as strong?

00:21:34.957 --> 00:21:37.040
MICHAEL POLLAN: I mean,
there's anecdotal research

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:38.123
that's really interesting.

00:21:38.123 --> 00:21:40.820
So one very relevant fact--

00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:43.520
at the same time we were
doing this imaging work

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:45.390
on psilocybin in
the human brain,

00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:48.110
there was another
researcher at Yale

00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:51.290
imaging the brains of very
experienced meditators, people

00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:54.170
who had 10,000 hours of
meditation experience.

00:21:54.170 --> 00:21:58.160
And they would go into
the fMRI and meditate,

00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:00.380
and their brains
looked identical.

00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:04.490
They also had this suppression
of the default mode network,

00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:07.430
and of course, that is the
state of kind of selflessness

00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:11.180
that people report
coming out of meditation.

00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:13.760
In terms of the monks,
these are people

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:17.240
with really long
experience meditation

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:21.281
in that they can almost at will
probably quiet the default mode

00:22:21.281 --> 00:22:21.780
network.

00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:25.730
There's a famous story about
Ram Dass, Richard Alpert,

00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:29.480
who was Timothy Leary's
collaborator during the Harvard

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:32.180
psilocybin project
in the early '60s.

00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:36.860
This guy went on to
become a guru basically,

00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:37.840
and he's still alive.

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:39.020
He's in Hawaii.

00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:41.240
And he was very
interested in psychedelics

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:43.310
and then found Hindu religion.

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:47.870
And he went to India, and
he told his guru about LSD.

00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:50.132
And his guru said,
I want to try it.

00:22:50.132 --> 00:22:52.340
I want to see what happens,
because you're telling me

00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:54.980
you're reaching this
spiritual plane on this drug,

00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:57.690
and that's my territory.

00:22:57.690 --> 00:23:01.670
And so Ram Dass
apparently gave him

00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:07.689
600 micrograms of LSD, which
is a beyond heroic dose.

00:23:07.689 --> 00:23:08.980
And that's what the guy wanted.

00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:10.521
He said, give me as
much as you have.

00:23:10.521 --> 00:23:11.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:14.360
And the monk-- or
whatever he is.

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:17.995
He's a guru, I guess-- takes
it, and nothing happened.

00:23:17.995 --> 00:23:20.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:21.450
Is this true?

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:23.600
I mean, Ram Dass
tells this story

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:27.540
and swears that it's true,
but it goes to your point.

00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:32.090
There are other ways to
achieve the same effect.

00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:33.920
Psychedelics are
probably a shortcut

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:36.890
to becoming a really good
meditator, but my guess is

00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:40.140
we will find at some point
that all the disciplines,

00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:43.190
the spiritual
disciplines that share

00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:48.530
this sense of
transcending the ego,

00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:50.340
are doing the same
thing in the brain--

00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:52.850
that that is where
that's happening.

00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:55.250
And I'm thinking of
sensory deprivation--

00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:57.594
if you get into these tanks,
sensory deprivation tanks.

00:23:57.594 --> 00:23:58.760
They're sort of coming back.

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:01.520
They were a thing in the '60s--

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:05.720
or fasting, or prayer, or
the right kind of music,

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:07.340
and breathing exercises.

00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:11.030
One of the psychedelic trips
I had involved no drugs--

00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:13.370
something called
holotropic breathwork.

00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:17.330
It's based on a yogic breathing
exercise where you essentially

00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:18.080
hyperventilate.

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:20.150
You breathe really fast.

00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:25.010
You exhale more than you inhale,
and you enter a trance state.

00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:28.310
It's the most uncanny
thing, and my guess

00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:31.610
is that hyperventilation is
starving the default mode

00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:35.780
network of oxygen and
reducing the activity there.

00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:38.780
So this is all areas
to be explored.

00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:41.870
We may find other ways to
achieve the same thing,

00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:43.310
but I think it's all connected.

00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:44.476
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:24:44.476 --> 00:24:46.219
MICHAEL POLLAN: Thank you.

00:24:46.219 --> 00:24:46.760
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:47.740
MICHAEL POLLAN: Hi.

00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:49.364
AUDIENCE: One of the
interesting trends

00:24:49.364 --> 00:24:51.130
that I've read about
on blogs and whatnot

00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:53.020
is the rise of microdosing.

00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:54.760
For those who don't
know, microdosing

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:57.750
is taking small
doses of psychedelics

00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:59.730
on a somewhat regular basis--

00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:02.750
far too small to actually
cause any sort of trip.

00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:04.665
And proponents of
microdosing claim

00:25:04.665 --> 00:25:07.390
that it can help with things
such as depression and anxiety,

00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:09.299
improve mood,
improve creativity.

00:25:09.299 --> 00:25:10.840
And I'm wondering
if you got a chance

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:13.367
to investigate microdosing
at all in your book,

00:25:13.367 --> 00:25:15.700
and if you get a sense that
some of the renewed research

00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:17.650
interest for high
dose experience

00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:20.540
might carry over into
researching whether microdosing

00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:22.330
is clinically
significant or not.

00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:24.150
MICHAEL POLLAN:
Excellent question.

00:25:24.150 --> 00:25:27.610
So microdosing is a very
interesting phenomenon.

00:25:27.610 --> 00:25:30.360
As the questioner said, it's
taking a sub-perceptual dose,

00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:33.010
often with LSD,
about 10 micrograms

00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:34.380
every third or fourth day.

00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:36.130
And the reason you
don't take it every day

00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:38.620
is because it would
lose its effect.

00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:40.260
The drugs kind of
cancel themselves out

00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:42.610
at a certain point.

00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:45.700
Many people anecdotally
report success

00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:47.530
with this, that it's
kind of a brain tonic,

00:25:47.530 --> 00:25:48.940
and it does help
with depression.

00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:50.689
There's a wonderful
book written about it,

00:25:50.689 --> 00:25:53.020
if you want to follow up,
by Ayelet Waldman called

00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:54.370
"A Really Good Day."

00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:57.910
And she's someone who's
struggled with depression

00:25:57.910 --> 00:26:00.330
for many years and
found more relief

00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:02.680
on this regime of
microdosing, and she's

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:06.910
been through the whole
pharmacopoeia, I'm sure.

00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:09.670
The reason I don't spend a
lot of time on it in the book

00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:14.080
is that there isn't yet anything
beyond the anecdotal reports.

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:15.070
They're interesting.

00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:17.560
They're really
provocative, and they're

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:19.630
being systematically connected.

00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:22.280
If you go online, there's a
guy named James Fadiman, who

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:25.330
is one of the first
generation researchers who's

00:26:25.330 --> 00:26:27.670
advising people on the
protocol, and soliciting

00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:31.610
reports, and getting this
interesting data set,

00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:35.525
but it has not been trialed
the way the large dose

00:26:35.525 --> 00:26:36.850
psilocybin has.

00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:39.290
I hear that these trials
are about to happen,

00:26:39.290 --> 00:26:41.620
and so we may get some
really solid information

00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:44.000
on whether microdosing works.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.240
The fact is, though, there
is such a strong placebo

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:49.160
effect with psychedelics--

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:51.580
they're so suggestible--
that it's very easy

00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:53.800
to see how it would work.

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:56.920
Just the very idea that you're
taking a small dose of LSD

00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:00.250
probably would have
an effect, but is

00:27:00.250 --> 00:27:02.620
it a pharmacological
effect or a placebo effect?

00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:05.680
That's what remains
to be learned.

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:08.810
So I'm skeptical about it.

00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:10.840
I do want the
research to happen,

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:14.380
and this interest
in m if you will,

00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:18.280
has stimulated people to fund
some research, some of which

00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:21.490
will be underground and some
of which will be above ground.

00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:24.021
So I'm very excited to see
what they come up with.

00:27:24.021 --> 00:27:24.520
Thanks.

00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:25.353
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:29.300
AUDIENCE: Thanks for
being here today.

00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:31.592
Wozniak pretty
famously said that LSD

00:27:31.592 --> 00:27:33.550
was one of the things
that differentiated Apple

00:27:33.550 --> 00:27:34.175
from Microsoft.

00:27:34.175 --> 00:27:34.833
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:34.833 --> 00:27:37.075
MICHAEL POLLAN: I think
Jobs said that, too.

00:27:37.075 --> 00:27:38.650
AUDIENCE: And at
this organization,

00:27:38.650 --> 00:27:41.920
we selected apocryphally
Eric Schmidt as CEO

00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:45.280
because he was the candidate
that had been to Burning Man.

00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:47.080
As an external
observer, I'm curious

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:49.150
what are your observations
about the intersection

00:27:49.150 --> 00:27:52.695
between psychedelics and
the technology-- or the tech

00:27:52.695 --> 00:27:53.230
industry.

00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:56.110
MICHAEL POLLAN: It's a really
interesting relationship.

00:27:56.110 --> 00:27:57.820
So Steve Jobs
famously said, too, it

00:27:57.820 --> 00:28:00.040
had been formative to his
intellectual development,

00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:01.623
and I thought it was
him, but maybe it

00:28:01.623 --> 00:28:03.580
was Wozniak who
said that Windows

00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:06.610
would have been a much
better product had Gates ever

00:28:06.610 --> 00:28:07.570
taken LSD.

00:28:07.570 --> 00:28:10.750
It was a really mean
thing to say, I think.

00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:12.967
And Gates immediately
said, but I did, but I did.

00:28:12.967 --> 00:28:14.199
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:14.199 --> 00:28:14.990
But it didn't work.

00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:16.198
It must not have been enough.

00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:21.880
And I thought this was
the beginning of the tech

00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:24.340
community's interest
in these drugs,

00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:25.489
because it's very current.

00:28:25.489 --> 00:28:27.280
I mean, you know better
than I, but I mean,

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:29.280
I've talked to lots of
people in Silicon Valley,

00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:31.810
and it's a big part of
the culture right now.

00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:34.120
Microdosing,
macrodosing-- I mean,

00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:37.460
I know one prominent
tech company that uses it

00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:39.820
in their management training--

00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:41.890
LSD.

00:28:41.890 --> 00:28:46.480
So there's a lot
of interest there,

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:48.370
and it is the tech
community, as I said,

00:28:48.370 --> 00:28:51.490
that's funding a lot
of this research.

00:28:51.490 --> 00:28:57.430
But it turns out that engineers
have been interested in LSD

00:28:57.430 --> 00:28:59.860
back in the '50s
and that there's

00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:01.240
this very interesting episode.

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:04.660
Before Timothy Leary and the
whole '60s psychedelic story

00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:08.590
that we think we know so well,
there was this research period,

00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:11.950
and there was this very
interesting character, who's

00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:14.380
kind of a counterpart to
Leary, named Al Hubbard,

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:15.796
and I tell this
story in the book.

00:29:15.796 --> 00:29:17.680
He's a very mysterious figure.

00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:21.220
He's involved with the
OSS, which became the CIA.

00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:24.460
He's playing both
sides of many worlds,

00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:29.350
but he had a vision
in 1951 that told him

00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:32.980
he could be involved in a
major civilization change.

00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:34.780
He realized it was LSD.

00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:38.076
He went to Sandoz, which
owned the patent on it.

00:29:38.076 --> 00:29:39.700
It was a Swiss
pharmaceutical company--

00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:41.980
persuaded them to
give him something

00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:46.150
like a liter bottle
of LSD, which probably

00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:50.410
is enough to trip a third
of the population of Earth

00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:51.520
at that point.

00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:53.350
I mean, just an
incredible amount,

00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:55.840
which he keeps buried in
Death Valley at his place.

00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:57.670
And anyway, he's
a great character.

00:29:57.670 --> 00:29:59.380
He's so much more
interesting than Leary.

00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:02.860
So he becomes the
Johnny Appleseed of LSD,

00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:05.560
but he's got a different theory.

00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:07.090
He was kind of a
conservative guy.

00:30:07.090 --> 00:30:09.550
He wanted to turn
on the elite, so he

00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:16.050
was going to do captains of
industry, engineers, artists,

00:30:16.050 --> 00:30:18.226
people in the church,
the Catholic church.

00:30:18.226 --> 00:30:20.600
And he would go around with
this satchel tripping people.

00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:22.330
Remember, it was legal then.

00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:25.460
And he became a
very gifted guide.

00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:30.340
So he has his eye on the tech
world as one of the places

00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:32.680
where you could have
this multiplier effect.

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:35.410
So he turns on a
couple engineers

00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:39.490
who are working at a company
called Ampex, which is actually

00:30:39.490 --> 00:30:42.280
one of the first Silicon
Valley companies in the '50s.

00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:45.010
They make magnetic tape,
on which, as you know,

00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:46.540
all computer
information was stored,

00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:49.380
but also video and
sound recording.

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:51.010
They had 40,000
people in the valley

00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:53.350
before it was called
Silicon Valley.

00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:56.710
And the head of
strategic planning,

00:30:56.710 --> 00:30:59.209
he turned on, and another
guy, and actually Ampex--

00:30:59.209 --> 00:31:01.000
for a while, it was
going to be the world's

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.980
first psychedelic company,
but the president was Jewish,

00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:07.480
and Al Hubbard was Catholic.

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:10.180
And he kept bringing in
crucifixes and things,

00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:14.050
and the president said go away.

00:31:14.050 --> 00:31:15.880
So but anyway, so
these engineers,

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:18.550
though, were so taken
with this experience

00:31:18.550 --> 00:31:21.190
that they left the company--

00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:22.780
a group of three
or four engineers--

00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:25.030
and started a big research--

00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:27.550
something called the
International Foundation

00:31:27.550 --> 00:31:31.420
for Advanced Research,
and they were doing

00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:33.394
a lot of psychedelic research.

00:31:33.394 --> 00:31:34.810
And I've always
been interested as

00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:38.050
to why engineers in particular
had such a strong reaction

00:31:38.050 --> 00:31:42.250
to this drug, and I talked to
a couple engineers about it.

00:31:42.250 --> 00:31:44.200
And you can tell
me if this chimes

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:48.010
with your sense of things,
but this one guy in particular

00:31:48.010 --> 00:31:49.400
told me that--

00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:53.470
and some of the early chip
designers were into LSD.

00:31:53.470 --> 00:31:55.780
It's very hard to design
a chip without a computer,

00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:57.970
but of course, at the
beginning, you had to.

00:31:57.970 --> 00:32:01.630
And you could hold this complex
3D structure in your head

00:32:01.630 --> 00:32:04.250
with the help of the drug.

00:32:04.250 --> 00:32:07.224
And this guy said-- oh,
and one of the-- sorry, one

00:32:07.224 --> 00:32:08.890
of the early people
at the International

00:32:08.890 --> 00:32:10.900
Foundation for Advanced
Study who was tripped

00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:12.550
was someone you
probably know if you

00:32:12.550 --> 00:32:14.350
know your history
of your industry,

00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:19.930
but Doug Engelbart,
who invented the mouse,

00:32:19.930 --> 00:32:22.900
and the interface, and
email, and everything.

00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:24.730
There was this
mother of all demos.

00:32:24.730 --> 00:32:28.990
Well, that guy got LSD
from those Ampex guys,

00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:32.470
and under the influence-- they
were doing a creativity study--

00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:34.861
he invented something then.

00:32:34.861 --> 00:32:35.860
It wasn't that profound.

00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:39.490
It was something he called
the tinkle toy to toilet train

00:32:39.490 --> 00:32:42.930
boys, and it was something you
could aim a stream of urine at,

00:32:42.930 --> 00:32:46.310
and it would make things happen.

00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:52.006
It's not quite the mouse,
but it was pretty cool,

00:32:52.006 --> 00:32:53.200
but it primed the pump.

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:54.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:56.200
So anyway, where was I?

00:32:56.200 --> 00:33:00.201
So this engineer I was talking
to said, well, the problem--

00:33:00.201 --> 00:33:02.200
if you're an engineer as
opposed to a scientist,

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:04.000
a scientist can--

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.840
their goal is to reduce
problems to the simplest terms,

00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:11.260
but engineers are faced with
an irreducible complexity

00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:12.920
and number of variables.

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:14.290
So the challenge is different.

00:33:14.290 --> 00:33:17.800
The challenge becomes
finding pattern,

00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:20.170
and psychedelics-- one of
the things that happens

00:33:20.170 --> 00:33:23.840
is you find pattern where
you didn't see it before.

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:26.800
And that, he thought,
was why so many engineers

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:29.350
found this a useful tool.

00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:31.150
I think that's fascinating.

00:33:31.150 --> 00:33:33.940
John Markham wrote an
interesting history

00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:37.120
about Silicon
Valley and the '60s,

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:40.030
and there's some very
good stuff on drugs.

00:33:40.030 --> 00:33:42.430
And he interviewed Jobs
about his experience,

00:33:42.430 --> 00:33:47.590
but yeah, it's part of
the tradition you're in.

00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:48.470
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:50.499
MICHAEL POLLAN: You're welcome.

00:33:50.499 --> 00:33:51.040
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:51.840
MICHAEL POLLAN: Hi.

00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:53.340
AUDIENCE: So you
talked a little bit

00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:55.150
about how every
culture in the world

00:33:55.150 --> 00:33:56.710
has experienced
this to some degree

00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:58.590
or is integrated
into their culture,

00:33:58.590 --> 00:34:01.390
and I'm curious from a sort of
anthropological perspective,

00:34:01.390 --> 00:34:04.690
because I imagine there's
a huge range in the way

00:34:04.690 --> 00:34:07.180
that these drugs
are applied, right?

00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:09.300
It's a select few, or
it's open to everyone,

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:12.100
or it's ritualistic, or
it's ordinary, or whatever.

00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:14.290
Are there other sort
of cultural patterns

00:34:14.290 --> 00:34:19.107
that can be deduced or
associated from the drug

00:34:19.107 --> 00:34:20.190
use within those cultures?

00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:21.219
MICHAEL POLLAN: That's
a good question.

00:34:21.219 --> 00:34:22.844
I actually think we
have a lot to learn

00:34:22.844 --> 00:34:25.070
from the traditional
use of these drugs.

00:34:25.070 --> 00:34:26.900
So we're going to
stay on psychedelics,

00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:29.192
and there are lots
of plant drugs

00:34:29.192 --> 00:34:31.150
that are not that
controversial, like caffeine,

00:34:31.150 --> 00:34:33.510
although in some
cultures they might be.

00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:35.770
But psychedelics have
been used for it looks

00:34:35.770 --> 00:34:37.389
like several thousand years.

00:34:37.389 --> 00:34:40.989
It appears that the
ancient Greeks--

00:34:40.989 --> 00:34:42.870
all the writers you've
heard of participated

00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:46.120
in an annual ritual
that involved

00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:47.440
what seems to be a psychedelic.

00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:49.750
It was called the kykeon.

00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:54.760
It was an annual rite in honor
of Demeter, harvest related.

00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:59.800
It was called the
Eleusinian Mysteries,

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:01.730
and everybody was sworn
to secrecy about this,

00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:03.230
so we don't know
that much about it,

00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:07.360
but everybody took this potion
and went to the underworld,

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:09.130
had experiences of a beyond.

00:35:09.130 --> 00:35:12.460
And it was very profound, and it
was the only time you were ever

00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:13.870
allowed to take this drug.

00:35:13.870 --> 00:35:15.850
We don't know what the drug was.

00:35:15.850 --> 00:35:18.160
And in fact, one
person was caught

00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:23.020
using the drug at a party and
was imprisoned, or killed,

00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:23.680
or something.

00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:24.685
It was a big crime.

00:35:27.210 --> 00:35:28.980
The lesson, I
think-- the takeaway

00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:31.440
from lots of traditional
cultures' use

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:34.170
is that they recognize
that these were very

00:35:34.170 --> 00:35:39.480
powerful medicines not
to be treated casually

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:43.500
and that they all surrounded
the use of their plant medicine,

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:47.490
as they often call it,
with ritual, ceremony,

00:35:47.490 --> 00:35:50.230
elders in attendance.

00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:51.870
It was never careless.

00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:53.170
It was never casual.

00:35:53.170 --> 00:35:54.570
It was never recreational.

00:35:54.570 --> 00:35:56.790
It was a profound experience.

00:35:56.790 --> 00:36:00.850
And I think when the drugs
hit the west, beginning in

00:36:00.850 --> 00:36:03.850
the late '50s, early
'60s, we didn't

00:36:03.850 --> 00:36:06.340
have any container for them.

00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:07.750
We didn't have rituals.

00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:10.360
We just kind of took
a handful of mushrooms

00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:15.480
and went to a concert, or we
drank LSD from the punch bowl.

00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:19.450
And I think that's why some
people really got in trouble.

00:36:19.450 --> 00:36:21.730
And so the lesson that
we failed to learn

00:36:21.730 --> 00:36:24.610
was that, yes, these drugs
have been ancient lineage,

00:36:24.610 --> 00:36:26.020
but look how they were used.

00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:30.760
Look at what those cultures
learned by trial and error.

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:35.260
And now we see it in shamanic
ceremonies in South America.

00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:36.850
There were mushroom
cults in Mexico

00:36:36.850 --> 00:36:40.780
that went back we don't know how
long, but at least 1,000 years,

00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:44.740
but they were always taken
in a group with guidance

00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:47.740
with someone who wasn't
taking the drugs,

00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:50.410
and with enormous care.

00:36:50.410 --> 00:36:52.120
And I think that's
what we lost, and we

00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:54.820
need to now invent that
container for ourselves.

00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:57.520
Maybe it's this therapeutic
protocol I'm describing.

00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:59.740
I'm not sure, but
that's the cultural work

00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:01.367
that needs to be done.

00:37:01.367 --> 00:37:02.200
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:03.075
MICHAEL POLLAN: Sure.

00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:06.342
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:37:06.342 --> 00:37:08.980
I was wondering whether
in your research

00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:14.290
you'd come across
the video of a debate

00:37:14.290 --> 00:37:20.249
from 1967 between Timothy Leary
and Jerome Lettvin at MIT.

00:37:20.249 --> 00:37:21.040
MICHAEL POLLAN: No.

00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:21.820
Jerome?

00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:23.170
AUDIENCE: Lettvin.

00:37:23.170 --> 00:37:24.180
For those who don't--

00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:24.370
MICHAEL POLLAN: I
don't know who that is.

00:37:24.370 --> 00:37:26.440
AUDIENCE: --recognize
the name, Jerome Lettvin

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:29.290
was one of the pioneers
of neuroscience.

00:37:29.290 --> 00:37:32.050
He was one of the
four authors of one

00:37:32.050 --> 00:37:37.570
of the first papers on the
physiology of perception titled

00:37:37.570 --> 00:37:41.350
"What the Frog's Eye
Tells the Frog's Brain,"

00:37:41.350 --> 00:37:45.700
and he was also one of the most
charismatic professors at MIT

00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:47.480
in the 1960s.

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:52.270
And they held this
debate sometime in 1967,

00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:57.040
and Leary went first, and
he had the whole audience

00:37:57.040 --> 00:37:59.094
lulled into going along.

00:37:59.094 --> 00:38:00.760
MICHAEL POLLAN: He
was very charismatic.

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:04.810
AUDIENCE: And Lettvin got
up and said, bullshit.

00:38:04.810 --> 00:38:06.790
I think it may have
been the first time

00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:11.660
bullshit was allowed to be
said on broadcast television.

00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:19.000
Anyway, Lettvin's biggest
argument against taking LSD

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:23.230
was the phenomenon of
uncontrolled flashbacks

00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:25.790
and how that could get
people into trouble,

00:38:25.790 --> 00:38:29.110
but as I was standing in
line here, I looked it up,

00:38:29.110 --> 00:38:30.684
and it's on YouTube.

00:38:30.684 --> 00:38:31.600
MICHAEL POLLAN: Great.

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:34.840
AUDIENCE: The whole thing
actually ran about two hours.

00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:39.990
WGBH, public TV station,
recorded it and broadcast

00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:42.640
a one hour edited version.

00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:44.620
MICHAEL POLLAN: So
Lettvin, L-E-T-V-I-N?

00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:45.890
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:45.890 --> 00:38:48.360
Maybe one or two T's.

00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:48.865
Two T's?

00:38:48.865 --> 00:38:50.740
MICHAEL POLLAN: Well,
this is a good occasion

00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:53.707
to talk about risk, unless you
want to frame the question,

00:38:53.707 --> 00:38:55.290
but I'd love to
address that question.

00:38:55.290 --> 00:38:58.070
AUDIENCE: Actually, I'll
let you talk about it,

00:38:58.070 --> 00:39:01.270
but I just wanted to ask
one more side question.

00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:04.240
When you talk about
food, you almost always

00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:06.180
bring a bag of groceries.

00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:07.180
MICHAEL POLLAN: Oh, yes.

00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:07.900
Where's the mushrooms?

00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:10.483
AUDIENCE: I was wondering if you
brought a bag with you today.

00:39:10.483 --> 00:39:12.379
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:12.379 --> 00:39:14.920
MICHAEL POLLAN: Let me tell you
a little tutorial on the law.

00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:18.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:23.110
So I was a very nervous Nellie
doing these experiences.

00:39:23.110 --> 00:39:24.640
I didn't have a
lot of experience

00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:28.060
with psychedelics
in college, and even

00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:30.230
after I was really too
afraid to take these drugs.

00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:32.313
I didn't think I was
psychologically sturdy enough

00:39:32.313 --> 00:39:33.800
at that point in my life.

00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:37.480
And so before I dove
in for this project,

00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:41.740
I did a lot of research, as
I'm wont to do as a journalist,

00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:44.520
to figure out what are
the dangers, because there

00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:46.570
are lots of stories
you heard in the '60s.

00:39:46.570 --> 00:39:48.740
People staring at the sun
till they would go blind.

00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:50.740
That was one story.

00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:52.910
Scrambling of your chromosomes.

00:39:52.910 --> 00:39:54.580
Both those stories,
by the way, were--

00:39:54.580 --> 00:39:55.600
one was made up.

00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:57.790
The first was made up,
and that's been proven,

00:39:57.790 --> 00:40:00.610
and the chromosome story
was withdrawn within months.

00:40:00.610 --> 00:40:03.730
It was just really bad research.

00:40:03.730 --> 00:40:06.670
Psychotic breaks-- and
that did happen sometimes.

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:08.740
There are people at
risk for schizophrenia

00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:13.090
that an acid trip was
what tripped them off,

00:40:13.090 --> 00:40:14.667
but a lot of what was--

00:40:14.667 --> 00:40:16.000
well, let me divide it into two.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.900
There's physiological risk,
and there's psychological risk.

00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:25.270
On the physiological
side, it's stunning how--

00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:27.880
I don't want to overstate
this, but that how

00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:31.960
compared to other drugs that we
take routinely how nontoxic--

00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:35.440
relatively nontoxic
classic psychedelics are.

00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:40.400
And I'm talking about LSD,
psilocybin, DMT, mescaline.

00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:43.840
There is no known
lethal dose, which

00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:46.180
you can't say about
over-the-counter drugs

00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:50.860
you take for a cold or for pain.

00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:52.624
They're very few
molecules in your brain.

00:40:52.624 --> 00:40:54.040
They're washed out
really quickly,

00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:57.400
and they don't seem
to affect the--

00:40:57.400 --> 00:41:00.050
they affect your brain, and
they don't affect other parts.

00:41:00.050 --> 00:41:01.570
If you have a panic
attack, your blood pressure

00:41:01.570 --> 00:41:03.319
is going to go up, but
they don't directly

00:41:03.319 --> 00:41:05.380
affect other systems.

00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:08.980
That's one thing, and
they're also non-addictive.

00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:12.100
The first thought you have upon
finishing a psychedelic trip

00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:13.600
is, when can I do that again?

00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:16.960
It's actually, do I ever
have to do that again?

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:18.640
Because it's really intense.

00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:20.560
So they're not habit forming.

00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:22.546
If you give the rats--

00:41:22.546 --> 00:41:24.545
in that experiment where
the rat has two levers,

00:41:24.545 --> 00:41:26.860
and one is cocaine,
and one's food,

00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:30.120
and if he presses the lever,
he gets a dose of cocaine,

00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:33.790
and they'll press till they die
over and over and over again.

00:41:33.790 --> 00:41:35.387
You put LSD in that contraption.

00:41:35.387 --> 00:41:36.970
They'll press it
once and never again.

00:41:36.970 --> 00:41:38.920
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:40.525
I mean, imagine
being a rat on LSD.

00:41:40.525 --> 00:41:44.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:44.830 --> 00:41:47.540
So from the physiological
point of view,

00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:52.090
they're safer than a lot
of drugs we take routinely,

00:41:52.090 --> 00:41:54.340
and I was surprised to
learn that, frankly.

00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:58.660
Psychologically-- it's very hard
to sort through the stories.

00:41:58.660 --> 00:42:01.420
The flashback phenomenon,
which I've heard

00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:06.692
reported, I have never found
any really good research on it,

00:42:06.692 --> 00:42:07.900
and I'm still looking for it.

00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:10.350
If anybody has a good paper
on that, I'd love to see it.

00:42:13.770 --> 00:42:17.430
I've kind of flashed on things
that happened in my experience

00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:22.470
because they're part of my store
of powerful psychic memories.

00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:23.330
Is that a flashback?

00:42:23.330 --> 00:42:26.640
I don't think so because I
can get it out of my head,

00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:31.030
but there are people
who have these unbidden

00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:34.540
moments of consciousness
that may be connected

00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:36.550
to what happened to them.

00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:39.190
I haven't heard
that they interfere

00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:42.100
with people's life
or mental health,

00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:45.250
but it's a question mark.

00:42:45.250 --> 00:42:47.860
The great danger
is the danger you

00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:50.890
have drinking too much, also,
which is doing stupid things,

00:42:50.890 --> 00:42:53.890
walking into traffic, falling.

00:42:53.890 --> 00:42:55.660
All that happens
on psychedelics,

00:42:55.660 --> 00:42:57.280
as it happens with
any powerful drug,

00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:59.990
and that's why a guide is
really important, somebody

00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:01.630
to look out for your body.

00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:04.150
In the studies
that have gone on,

00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:06.955
there have now
been 1,000 dosings

00:43:06.955 --> 00:43:09.910
of people who have been screened
for mental health problems

00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:12.580
and things like that,
and there has not

00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:15.970
been a single serious
adverse event.

00:43:15.970 --> 00:43:19.095
So are there adverse events
when people use the drugs

00:43:19.095 --> 00:43:19.720
recreationally?

00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:21.969
Yes, we all know people who
have had really bad trips,

00:43:21.969 --> 00:43:24.250
and they usually stop
using it at that point--

00:43:24.250 --> 00:43:26.740
felt trapped, had
panic reactions.

00:43:26.740 --> 00:43:31.960
But often psychiatrists who
didn't know this territory

00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:37.030
would misinterpret a panic
reaction as a psychotic break,

00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:38.440
because it sure looks like that.

00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:39.460
You're having delusions.

00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:40.900
You're hearing voices.

00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:43.480
I mean, to an
average psychiatrist,

00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:46.990
this would say psychosis, but
often it was a panic attack.

00:43:46.990 --> 00:43:51.040
I interviewed Andrew Weil,
Dr. Andrew Weil, about this,

00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:53.500
and he was very interested
in psychedelics in the '60s.

00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:55.480
He was at Harvard
when Leary was there,

00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:58.630
and when he graduated from
medical school in 1968,

00:43:58.630 --> 00:44:01.630
he went out to San
Francisco and volunteered

00:44:01.630 --> 00:44:03.980
at the Haight-Ashbury
free clinic.

00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:06.880
And they were seeing
lots of LSD casualties,

00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:09.580
as they call it-- people
coming in, having bad trips,

00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:12.190
thinking they're losing
their mind or they're dying.

00:44:12.190 --> 00:44:14.320
And he knew the
territory really well,

00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:15.912
having used a lot
of psychedelics,

00:44:15.912 --> 00:44:17.620
and he would come into
the little cubicle

00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:20.050
with somebody who was
completely freaking out.

00:44:20.050 --> 00:44:22.960
And he had on his white
coat, and his stethoscope,

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:24.994
and his clipboard, and
he'd ask a few questions.

00:44:24.994 --> 00:44:27.160
And then he'd say to the
person, will you excuse me?

00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:29.980
There's someone in the next
room who's really in trouble,

00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:30.700
and he'd leave.

00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:32.741
And they were like, wow,
someone's more fucked up

00:44:32.741 --> 00:44:35.030
than I am, and they
would suddenly feel fine.

00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:35.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:35.530 --> 00:44:39.170
It would just
completely subside.

00:44:39.170 --> 00:44:43.560
So suggestibility is a very
big part of the experience.

00:44:46.819 --> 00:44:49.360
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much
for coming to talk to us today.

00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:50.610
MICHAEL POLLAN: Oh, thank you.

00:44:50.610 --> 00:44:53.260
Thanks for your great questions.

00:44:53.260 --> 00:44:53.860
Thank you.

00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:58.410
[APPLAUSE]
